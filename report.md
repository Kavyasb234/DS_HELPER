# Retail Sales Insights with SQL + Python

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how databases and data science integrate to extract business insights. We designed a retail sales database, used SQL for analysis, and visualized results in Python using the ds_helper library.

## Database Design and Schema Diagram
The database consists of three tables with relationships:

- **Products**: id (PK), name, category, price
- **Customers**: id (PK), name, age, email
- **Sales**: id (PK), product_id (FK to Products), customer_id (FK to Customers), quantity, sale_date, total_amount

Schema Diagram (Text-based):
```
Products (1) ---- (many) Sales (many) ---- (1) Customers
```

## Insights from SQL Queries
1. **Best-Selling Product**: Book with 5 units sold.
2. **Total Sales per Category**:
   - Electronics: $5,275.00
   - Clothing: $370.00
   - Books: $75.00
3. **Average Purchase per Customer**:
   - Alice Johnson: $650.00
   - Bob Smith: $625.00
   - Ivy Chen: $600.00
   - Henry Davis: $440.00
   - Jack Taylor: $300.00
   - Grace Lee: $70.00
   - Diana Prince: $47.50
   - Eve Wilson: $45.00
   - Frank Miller: $45.00
   - Charlie Brown: $37.50
4. **Daily Sales Trends**: Daily sales range from $25.00 to $1,200.00, with peaks on certain dates.
5. **Monthly Sales Trends**: October 2023 total sales: $5,720.00.

## Visualizations
Screenshots of visualizations are saved as PNG files (generated by ds_helper.visualize):

- Best-Selling Product: Bar chart showing product names and quantities.
- Total Sales per Category: Bar chart of categories vs. total sales.
- Average Purchase per Customer: Bar chart of customer names vs. average purchase.
- Daily Sales Trends: Line plot of dates vs. daily sales.
- Monthly Sales Trends: Bar chart of months vs. monthly sales.

## Observations and Conclusions
1. **Best-Selling Product**: Book is the top seller with 5 units, suggesting popularity in educational or leisure reading. Recommendation: Expand book inventory and promote reading-related products.
2. **Total Sales per Category**: Electronics generate the highest revenue ($5,275), followed by Clothing ($370) and Books ($75). Electronics account for about 92% of total sales. Recommendation: Continue focusing on electronics but introduce promotions for other categories to diversify revenue.
3. **Average Purchase per Customer**: Alice Johnson has the highest average purchase ($650), indicating potential for upselling to high-value customers. Younger customers tend to have higher averages, possibly due to tech purchases. Recommendation: Develop loyalty programs targeting high-average customers.
4. **Daily Sales Trends**: Sales vary significantly daily, from $25 to $1,200, with an average of $286 per day. Peaks occur on certain dates, possibly due to promotions or events. Recommendation: Analyze peak days to replicate successful strategies and stabilize sales through consistent marketing.
5. **Monthly Sales Trends**: October 2023 shows total sales of $5,720, indicating a strong month. With only one month of data, further monitoring is needed. Recommendation: Track monthly trends over time to identify seasonal patterns and adjust inventory accordingly.

## Analytical/Statistical Component
- Average daily sales: $286.00 (calculated as total sales $5,720 / 20 days), with high variability (range $25 to $1,200), indicating potential for growth through targeted promotions.
- Electronics category accounts for 92.3% of total revenue ($5,275 / $5,720), showing strong dependency on tech products but also opportunity to diversify.
- Customer age vs. purchase: From the data, younger customers (e.g., Alice 28, Bob 35) have higher average purchases ($650, $625), suggesting a correlation between age and spending on electronics. Growth rate in sales could be analyzed with more data, but October shows a total increase from initial projections.

Business Recommendations:
- Increase electronics inventory.
- Offer discounts on non-electronics to balance categories.
- Personalize marketing based on age groups.
